# LearnSL

The goal of LearnSL is to provide a set of functions to perform supervised classification along with comprehensive explanations of the algorithms, their pros and cons, and their applications.

## Installation

You can install the released version of LearnSL from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("LearnSL")
```

You can install the development version of LearnSL from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ComiSeng/LearnSL")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to classify a dataset:

```{r example_1}
library(LearnSL)
multivariate_linear_regression(db1rl)
```

This is yet another example of an implemented classification algorithm, showing the step by step process:

```{r example_2}
library(LearnSL)
knn(db_flowers,"ClassLabel", c(6.7, 1.5, 5.3, 2.1), "Euclidean", 2, details = TRUE, waiting = FALSE)
```
